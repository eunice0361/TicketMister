# TicketMister
Our project, Ticketmister, aims to address the challenges of ticket fraud and scalping within the live entertainment industry by leveraging a blockchain-enabled ticketing system. Harnessing the core principles of blockchain, such as immutability and transparency, Ticketmister endeavours to establish a secure platform where users can confidently buy and sell tickets.

To achieve its objectives, Ticketmister distinguishes itself from traditional ticketing systems through three key features.
1.2.1 Verification of Ticket Authenticity

Tickets can be issued by the event organiser in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are designed specifically for the event, and a specific seat number or set of event perks. Given that NFTs can neither be copied nor substituted, potential cases of fraudulent or invalid tickets are effectively eliminated. By verifying that the ticket or the NFT, is indeed created by the organiser, buyers can also be assured of the ticket’s authenticity regardless of whether they purchased it in the primary or secondary market. 
1.2.2 Verification of Ticket Ownership

As all ticket-related transactions will take place on the blockchain, the transfer of ownerships would also be recorded on the immutable ledger. Thus, buyers, regardless of who they purchased the ticket from, can verify that the seller indeed has the rightful ownership of the ticket they are selling. In addition, ticket buyers can also be rest assured that their ownership of the ticket can be verified after purchase, leaving no room for cases of tickets already being used by another person. 
1.2.3 Facilitation of Ticket Gifting & Resale

To prevent issues related to ticket frauds and scalping, event organisers are also given the autonomy to control how the resale of their tickets would take place by setting maximum resale prices. Thus, cases of overinflated ticket prices can be mitigated, resulting in greater consumer satisfaction and reduced risks to the organiser’s reputation. Moreover, given that the tickets or NFTs, can only be traded on TicketMister, a fair and competitive resale market can be ensured, should it take place.
